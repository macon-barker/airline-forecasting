# airline-forecasting
Used ARIMA model to forecast cancelled flights and lost baggage to recommend best airline and travel month to agency.
Data set included 7 years of monthly flight data from 3 different airlines. 
ACF and PACF were used to select model terms. Seasonality was also addressed. 
After terms chosen and residuals confirmed to be white noise, forecast was generated and compared based on error (MAPE).
Final deliverable was a report with recommendations to a business audience.
